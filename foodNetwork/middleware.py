# NOTE:
# In a real-world scenario, security practices should be comprehensive and multi-layered to ensure the protection of sensitive information and resources, especially when dealing with admin interfaces that have access to critical parts of the application. While the provided solution is a step towards restricting access to the admin interface, there are some considerations to take into account for a production-grade setup:

# HTTPS: Ensure that your site is served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and prevent various types of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

# Authentication Backend: Depending on the complexity and security requirements of your application, you might consider using more advanced authentication backends, such as OAuth with third-party providers or integration with enterprise authentication systems like LDAP or Active Directory.

# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implementing MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification to access sensitive resources.

# Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track and analyze access to the admin interface, detect suspicious activities, and respond to security incidents promptly.

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define and enforce granular access control policies based on roles and permissions to limit the actions users can perform within the admin interface.

# Regular Security Audits and Updates: Regularly review and update security configurations, libraries, and dependencies to address known vulnerabilities and emerging threats.

# Security Headers: Utilize security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection) to mitigate common web security vulnerabilities, such as XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking.

# External Security Audits: Periodically engage external security experts or conduct security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your application's security posture.

# Compliance Requirements: Ensure that your security practices align with relevant regulatory compliance standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS, if applicable to your business domain.

# Incident Response Plan: Develop and document an incident response plan outlining procedures for handling security breaches, including communication protocols, containment strategies, and recovery measures.

# By incorporating these practices into your security strategy, you can enhance the resilience of your application against potential security threats and maintain the trust of your users and stakeholders. Additionally, consulting with cybersecurity experts and staying informed about emerging security trends and best practices is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture in a real-world, enterprise-level environment.
